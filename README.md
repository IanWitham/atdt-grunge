# At the Drive-Thru Podcast website

Site designed and implemented by me.

Tech stack:

- ReactJS / Remix (Grunge Stack)
- Tailwind CSS
- [Architect](https://arc.codes) AWS deployment framework

Episode data is pulled hourly from a LibSyn RSS feed by a scheduled AWS Lambda function.

The site itself runs serverless on Lambda.
